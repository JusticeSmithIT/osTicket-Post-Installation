<br />
<br />

Create a new agent. For the sake of this demonstration, I use "Jane Doe," and "John Doe." These will be the agents that you will work the ticket as. <br/>

<br />
<br />


Under the Access tab, assign your agent to a department and access that you want them to have. You can name your department what you want but I used "SysAdmin" and for the access, "Supreme admin," which I created myself. <br/>

<br />
<br />
Next, we are creating our second agent, John Doe, who will be on the support team. You can give him whatever access you want, it says view only but I gave him "Supreme Admin" access as well just for the demonstration.   <br/>

<br />
<br />
Under the Agents tab, you can see all of the agents/admin and their access that you just created.  <br/>
